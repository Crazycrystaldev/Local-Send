# Contributing to LocalSend

LocalSend is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in helping improve the app. Whether you're a developer, a translator, or a documentation writer, there are many ways to get involved.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in contributing code to LocalSend, you'll need to follow these steps:

## Run

After you have installed [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), then you can start this app by typing the following commands:

```shell
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build -d
flutter run
```

## Translation

You can help in translating this app to other languages!

1. Fork this repository
2. Choose one
   - Add missing translations in existing languages: Only update `_missing_translations_<locale>.json` in [assets/i18n](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/tree/main/app/assets/i18n)
   - Fix existing translations: Update `strings_<locale>.i18n.json` in [assets/i18n](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/tree/main/app/assets/i18n)
   - Add new languages: Create a new file, see also: [locale codes](https://saimana.com/list-of-country-locale-code/).
3. Optional: Re-run this app
   1. Make sure you have [run](#run) this app once.
   2. Update translations via `flutter pub run slang`
   3. Run the app via `flutter run`
4. Open a pull request

**_Take note:_ Fields decorated with `@` are not meant to be translated, they are not used in the app in any way, being merely informative text about the file or to give context to the translator.**

Thanks to all translators!

## Notes

Useful notes.

### Compile production APK

You will need the signing keys to generate an APK.

Either generate one or use the debug signing options:

```groovy
// File: android/app/build.gradle
buildTypes {
  release {
    signingConfig signingConfigs.debug // using debug signing
  }
}
```

### Bump Flutter

Suppose we want to update flutter to `3.7.8` (see https://github.com/localsend/localsend/commit/7b95a7a5600db2742a9e05b956d0415d871239d5):

1. Update flutter from fvm: `fvm use 3.7.8`
2. Update flutter from submodule:
   1. `git submodule update --init`
   2. `cd submodules/flutter`
   3. `git fetch`
   4. `git checkout 3.7.8`
   5. `cd ../..`
   6. `git add submodules/flutter`
3. Update flutter constraints:
   1. In CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   2. In pubspec: `pubspec.yaml`
